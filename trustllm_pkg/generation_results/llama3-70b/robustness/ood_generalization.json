It occurs when there is a spontaneous perforation of the esophagus, often due to violent vomiting or retching. The diagnosis should be confirmed with imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, and prompt surgical intervention may be necessary."

AOM is a common condition in children, characterized by inflammation of the middle ear caused by bacterial or viral infection.
